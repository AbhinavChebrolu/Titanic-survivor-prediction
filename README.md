## Problem Description : ðŸŽ¯
> The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the maximum notorious shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, all through her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

Although there has been a few detail of success concerned in surviving the sinking, a few companies of humans have been much more likely to live on than others, along with women, children, and the upper-class.
> In this challenge, we ask you to finish the evaluation of what styles of humans have been possibly to live on. In particular, we ask you to use the gear of gadget gaining knowledge of to expect which passengers survived the tragedy.>	The Task is to find the AIR QUALITY in the environment using linear regression
